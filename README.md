# SER-with-ConvNet-and-MFCCs
"Speech Emotion Recognition with ConvNet and MFCCs" employs Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) to extract patterns from Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) in speech data. This method aims to discern and classify emotions conveyed through spoken words or expressions.
